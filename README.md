# TopSeed

TopSeed aims to be a showcase of best practices and approaches for developers and designers
who want to build stunning mobile-first web apps with some of the best technologies
available now. Some may call it a stack. Some may call it an architecture. 

TopSeed may provide some answers to those 
who look for great designs.

What technologies make our cut? Those that let us be the most
productive and creative. And that we know to be maintainable. And that we expect 
to be future-safe.

Architecture is like a kindergarden: we put the shoes here, the jackets over there,
and now we know where to find things. That made it very successful in its time.
We DO aim to follow this great legacy, and propose approaches that make it easy
to design and develop cutting edge web apps.

We welcome scrutiny and feedback from anyone who tries to follow our approaches. 
We also welcome code contributions from seasoned designers and developers

## Some best practiced demonstrated:
- SPA
- Designer friendly
- SPA w/ SEO
- SPA and AMP
- Server side data-binding and in-browser data binding
- Loosely coupled to architectures
- Mostly static (easy to maintain/develop and scale)


## Getting started w/ a 'hello world':

- Download
- $cd webApp
- $npm install
- $node index

Now open browser on port 8081.
If you add ?w=1 you get www page, else it is mobile|AMP.

You can easily deploy to ZEIT, D.O> or such.
